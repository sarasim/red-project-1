## Experiences
Learning how to use basic HTML and CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing site was really exciting.  


Learning about JavaScript and how to use jQuery plugins was exciting and challenging. It took a little bit of time, but I was able to understand how to implement it into this project.

Git and GitHub are invaluable tools for version control and project backup.
